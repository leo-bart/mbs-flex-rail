# Convert 3D .stl file ("stereo lithography") to VPython 7 object.

# Limitations:
#    Code for binary files needs to be updated to VPython 7.
#    Does not deal with color.
#    Does not assign texpos values to vertex objects,
#      so cannot add a meaningful texture to the final compound object.

# Factory function and handling of binary files by Bruce Sherwood 1/26/10
# Conversion to VPython 7 by Bruce Sherwood 2018 May 8

# Give this factory function an .stl file and it returns a compound object,
# to permit moving and rotating.

# Specify the file as a file name.

# See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)
# Text .stl file starts with a header that begins with the word "solid".
# Binary .stl file starts with a header that should NOT begin with the word "solid",
# but this rule seems not always to be obeyed.
# Currently the 16-bit unsigned integer found after each triangle in a binary
# file is ignored; some versions of .stl files put color information in this value.
